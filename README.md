# ipynb-to-py---py-it
A mini mini mini project about converting ipynb file to py files. 

Run 'python convert.py (file_path) (prettify True or False)' to convert the .ipynb file you passed to .py file
if you didn't pass one of these args or both no worries, you will be asked about them :)

To intall the requirments dependencies run 'pip install requirments.txt'
